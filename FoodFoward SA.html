        <h2>Our Cause</h2>
        <p>Welcome to FoodFoward SA! We help fight hunger by redistributing surplus food. Our goal is to ensure that no food is put to waste and that every mouth possible is fed, beacause everybody deserves somthing to eat. FoodForward SA rescues surplus, nutritious food and redistributes it to charities and community
                programmes across South Africa. We work with retailers, manufacturers and farmers to ensure edible
                food reaches people rather than landfill. Together we reduce waste, fight hunger and support
                resilient communities.
